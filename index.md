### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because I learned how to play Black Jack.
    I wrote all the code to calculate the score. Programming 
    the project was very satisfying because once I programmed all the rules
    of the game, it ran perfectly. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I improved on the Black Jack program.
    I used functions for the first time to make my program more modular and
    organized. The program was pleasant to code and it felt satisfying making it run.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because I experienced using 2D Vectors. I also
    experienced using .h and .cc files and I iterated through the 2D vector to
    find the desired county and it's population. This lab is my favourite
    achievement because it is an example of how coding can be applied to the real world.
